### Abstract

Acoustic liners are widely used to damp sound waves propagating inside a duct or an
enclosure. They are generally found in a high-temperature environment; e.g. car exhaust
mufflers, exhaust ducts of aircraft jet engines, and inside the combustion chamber of gas
turbine engines.

Bias-flow acoustic liners are used to suppress thermo-acoustic instabilities developed in gas
turbines by increasing the acoustic losses of the system. Instabilities rise from the
interaction between acoustic waves and unsteady combustion. The acoustic performance of
liners is mathematically expressed in terms of its impedance. An apt impedance model is
required to effectively design the acoustic liner. There are many impedance models
available to estimate the liner impedance but most of them are semi-empirical and are
based on the experiments which are carried out at room temperatures. Hence, none takes
the effect of high temperature and temperature gradients across the liner into account
which is the case for most of the practical scenarios especially for gas-turbine applications
where the liner is subjected to temperatures as high as 1500 K.

The aim of the current work is to develop a formula to estimate the liner impedance at a
higher temperature by making use of existing impedance models.
